Introduction of Social Network 
                      A strong framework for simulating and examining social networks is offered by graphs. We can learn about relationships, impact, and community structures in a network by utilizing graph theory and the algorithms that go along with it. A social network is an arrangement of people or things (sometimes called nodes or vertices) linked by connections (edges).
                      
Describe the Social Network 
	A social network graph is one in which the nodes stand in for individuals, while the edges—the lines connecting the nodes—reflect the social ties that bind them together, such friendship or collaboration on a project. Both directed and undirected graphs are possible.
 
Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contribute to you or to the community?
	As a community development tool, social media and networking are crucial for fostering relationships, enhancing communication, recording development activities, exchanging information in real time, and educating and reaching a larger audience than ever before.
